Download the community version from [JetBrains web site][idea] or install it from the distro repository:

```sh
# pacman -S intellij-idea-community-edition
```

At the first time it is executed:

- Customize any configurations.

- Install the official scala plug-in.

- Install the additional plug-in `scalariform`.

- After the initial setup, go to `File -> Settings -> Keymap` and search for `scalariform` and change its shortcut to `Ctrl+Shift+S`.
